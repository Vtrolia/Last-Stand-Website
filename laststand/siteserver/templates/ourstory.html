<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Welcome to Last Stand Cloud Software, a new software architecture based on the idea of giving you control. Unlike other professional cloud services, you have the ability to make your own servers with no data caps. We handle everything on the software end for you.</p>
<p>Our special Desktop client has a full suite supporting all your cloud computing needs, from automatically scheduled back-ups of your computer to a cloud media server to just a normal cloud, partitioned in just the way you want.</p>
<p>While Last Stand Cloud currently does not have an HTTP browser client in operation for your servers, development for this way of communicating with the cloud is im development. The Desktop client utilizes a special, security and correctness based protocol called Reliable Cloud Protocol that was developed in-house and utilizes SSL/TLS security on top of that. Customer privacy and security is a top priority to us, as notable some other cloud services have been prone to embarassing leaks.</p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Last Stand grew out of a need for a remote cloud service that is customizable and scalable. Originally, I wanted to make a home cloud for my parents, while also allowing myself and my brother to usen the server as a backup for our computers while we were out at college.</p>
<p>I found out that there weren't any services that let you do this, and I wasn't about to spend a crap ton of money per month just to have a few gigs of storage. I figured I could make something myself, and broke out the ol' programming skills to make up what became Last Stand. I developed this software with security, redundancy and completeness in mind. I even created an entire new Application Layer protocol for this project!</p>
<p>If you're interested in this new protocol, I have the link to the draft I submitted here <a href="#" target="_blank">Click here.</a> If you're interested in C programming, Network/Socket programming or the process I used to create this software, you can check out my open-source library called "Networking.h" on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Vtrolia/Networking.h" target="_blank">Here</a>. All of the network functionality for Last Stand was buit using this library.</p>
