            <p>Last Stand Cloud is a personal cloud software. While there are plenty 
                of personal cloud hardware/software, there seems to be a distinct lack of cloud software for ordinary people to have their own cloud accessible from anywhere. Last Stand hopes to change that. Though still in Alpha, the core idea of this software is hopefully going to release publicly soon. Here, you can have as many clouds as you like, with however much storage as you'd like. This never affects your price. In practice, you never have to pay us for anything.
                </p>
                <p>The way that we intend to give our users a cloud accessible from anywhere, much like a large corporate cloud service, is much like many other, peer-to-peer software. Your cloud communicates to us, where it is and its storage capabilities, and when you connect to it we send you to a new connection to where your server says it is. The communications between us and your server and you are of course done over HTTPS, secure and encrypted. The communication between you and your server is all secured using Reliable Cloud Protocol. Much like a VPN service, all that is public is the fact that you connected to our web site.
